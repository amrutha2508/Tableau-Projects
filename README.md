### 1. Sales and Customer Dashboard
#### Sales Dashboard
The Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance. It includes key metrics such as total sales, total profits, and total quantities, with comparisons to the previous year. Increases and decreases in these metrics are clearly highlighted. The dashboard also displays detailed sales and profit information by product subcategory, comparing the present year’s data with the previous year’s. Additionally, sales and profit trends over time are shown for the current year, providing insights into performance fluctuations.

#### Customer Dashboard
The Customer Dashboard focuses on customer-related metrics, offering insights into total customers, sales per customer, and total orders, along with year-over-year comparisons, highlighting percentage increases or decreases. The dashboard features customer distribution based on the number of orders and displays the top 10 customers by profit. Like the Sales Dashboard, it includes filters for year, product category, subcategory, and location (region, state, and city), allowing for detailed analysis and segmentation.
